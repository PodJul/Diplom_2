The part ***Stellar Burgers API-tests*** is dedicated to test API, using RestAssured dependency. Also i used Gson to serialize and deserialized json.

***API documentation*** you can watch [here](https://code.s3.yandex.net/qa-automation-engineer/java/cheatsheets/paid-track/diplom/api-documentation.pdf) 


What test i had done:

* create new user
* create double user
* create user without required fields
* user authorization
* change user data
* create order
* get user oder
* delete user etc.

I used Postman to check all http-requests and responses while coding.
I generated final report,using Allure Framework with Steps.
